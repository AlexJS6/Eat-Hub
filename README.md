# **The previous Mission**  

we had to create a repository called _restaurant-css-framework_ in which we had to realise
a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of
food (burger, pizza, asian, ...) was our choice.

The website had to be*responsive*, at least for small and medium screens. It had to 
at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and
contact.

.Welcome
A page with one _Jumbotron_ and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc...).

.Menu
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

.Pictures
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per
page).

.Restaurant
A page about the restaurants (it's a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and
different schedules.

.Contact
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of
the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message
itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically
correct tag.  

# **The New Mission (Team Work)**  

[X] **In first place**    
 we had to assign each member of the team to a task.  

We decided to work in small groups for a better management of time. 

We've all decided to choose **Alexander** as our **Git Master**,    
His tasks :
* Create the Repository  
* Send an invitation to each team member  
* Merge the "Dev" branch into the "Master" branch.
